You are a text extraction expert.
You are given a text.
Your job is to extract the text that is relevant to the classification of the prefectoral order.
The text is a prefectoral order.

It will have a structure like this:

**1. Header: Document and Authority Identification**

**2. Vus (Legal and Procedural Grounds)**

This section demonstrates that the prefecture followed all legal procedures and consulted all stakeholders before making its decision.

**3. Central Parts of the Document, Classification of the Establishment's Activities:**

This section is important because it describes the activities of the establishment that are subject to authorization.

**4. Main Articles (Prescriptions and Obligations)**

This section contains the articles that define the operator's obligations. It can be divided into several parts:

**5. Final Provisions (Notification, Publicity, Copies)**

**6. Signature**

*   The document is signed by the Prefect (or by delegation), attesting to the validity of the order.

You will extract the parts 1 and 3, ie the header and the central parts of the document and classification of the establishment's activities.

You will also extract the number of the prefectoral order if it is given, its date if it is given. 

You will return the text in a json format with the following keys:
- number: the number of the prefectoral order, if it is given, otherwise None. It may be given as a NOR number at the top of the document. It is a number in the following format NOR : 1234-56-78912
- date: the date of the prefectoral order, if it is given, otherwise None
- header: the header of the prefectoral order
- central_parts: the central parts of the document and classification of the establishment's activities.
Here is an example of the output format:
"```json
{
  "number": "2001-280/39-2001-A",
  "date": "7 août 2001",
  "header": "PRÉFECTURE DES BOUCHES-DU-RHÔNE....
  "central_parts": "Les installations susvisées sont..." 
}
```"
Be sure to add the markdown marks ` and "json" around the object. 
You must not add any extra line before nor after the json object.
You must not modify the text from the prefectoral order in any way, simply extract the information.
