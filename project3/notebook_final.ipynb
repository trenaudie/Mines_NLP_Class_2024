    "\n",
    "This prefectural order aims to authorize and regulate temporary pumping tests conducted by ROXANE company in the municipalities of Saint-Céneri-le-Gérei and La Ferrière-Bochard. It follows ROXANE's declaration of its project to perform this operation (pursuant to Article L. 214-3 of the Environmental Code).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Authorized action:** \n",
    "Conducting complementary pumping tests on four boreholes (F1, F2, F3, and F4) with specific flow rates for each borehole, for a limited period (from 05/16/2022 to 12/16/2022).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose of the tests:**\n",
    "These tests aim to better understand the functioning of the groundwater table and to assess the potential impacts of permanent withdrawals on the environment, before any commercial exploitation of groundwater.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Main conditions imposed:**\n",
    "1. Minimum duration of tests: 7 months\n",
    "2. Obligation to implement continuous piezometric monitoring\n",
    "3. Implementation of daily rainfall monitoring\n",

    "### Thoughts on the manual classification\n",
    "We can see that the classification task is only the classification of the **label** such as **replace all** or **authorize action**. \n",

    "This section is important because it describes the activities of the establishment that are subject to authorization.\n",

    "**4. Main Articles (Prescriptions and Obligations)**\n",
    "\n",
    "This section contains the articles that define the operator's obligations. It can be divided into several parts:\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Here are the main labels that will be sought out in the prefectoral order texts: \n",
    "- **authorize action**. Most prefectoral orders fall into this category, as they authorize a company to do an activity such as an industrial project in a given location. Here, the target of the prefectoral order is a company, and the establishment affected by the prefectoral order is also this company. \n",
    "- **replace of modify existing order** Some prefectoral orders fall into this category, for they perform a modification to existing law, orders or prescriptions that apply to a given establishment's activities. In this case, the target of the prefectoral order is the lawm order of prescription text being modified or replaced, whilst the establishment being affected is the company. \n",
    "- **stop or block action**. When an establishment's action is prohibited by the prefectoral order. \n",

    "We choose to use the following models, as they are cheap, fast, state of the art in terms of accuracy and they are good with instructions (instruction-tuned). We stay away from \"reasoning models\" like Deepseek-R1 as they are too slow for our simple classification task. \n",
