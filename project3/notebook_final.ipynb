    "## First Examples\n",
    "Let's classify three different prefectoral orders in order to better understand the types of **labels**, **targets** and **text** to extract from the HTML files\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1: May 12 2022 Order on Subterrean pump tests\n",
    "Here is an image of the of prefectoral order\n",
    "\n",
    "# ![Prefectoral Order on Pump Tests](./figs/2022_05_12_pumping_img.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This prefectural order aims to authorize and regulate temporary pumping tests conducted by ROXANE company in the municipalities of Saint-Céneri-le-Gérei and La Ferrière-Bochard. It follows ROXANE's declaration of its project to perform this operation (pursuant to Article L. 214-3 of the Environmental Code).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Authorized action:** \n",
    "Conducting complementary pumping tests on four boreholes (F1, F2, F3, and F4) with specific flow rates for each borehole, for a limited period (from 05/16/2022 to 12/16/2022).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose of the tests:**\n",
    "These tests aim to better understand the functioning of the groundwater table and to assess the potential impacts of permanent withdrawals on the environment, before any commercial exploitation of groundwater.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Main conditions imposed:**\n",
    "1. Minimum duration of tests: 7 months\n",
    "2. Obligation to implement continuous piezometric monitoring\n",
    "3. Implementation of daily rainfall monitoring\n",
    "4. Monitoring of wetlands around the boreholes\n",
    "5. Compliance with maximum specific flow rates for each borehole\n",
    "\n",
    "For this prefectoral order a correct classification could be \n",
    "```json\n",
    "\"arrete prefectoral n° 2350-22-00082 du 12 mai 2022\": {\n",
    "    \"label\": \"authorize action\",\n",
    "    \"target\": \"S.A. ROXANE\",\n",
    "    \"text\": \"...\",\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We could also suggest the following classification, by considering this prefectoral order to be a simple appendum to the article L. 214-3 of the Environmental Code, adding addition conditions regarding the specific case of ROXANE's pumping test operation:\n",
    "```json\n",
    "\"arrete prefectoral n° 2350-22-00082 du 12 mai 2022\": {\n",
    " ***   \"label\": \"add conditions\",\n",
    "    \"target\": \"article L. 214-3 du code de l’environnement\",\n",
    "    \"text\": \"prescriptions techniques...\",\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "It is not easy to extract all the technical requirements from the article: there are many.  \n",
    "We could summarize them using a language model, but that is not the spirit of this key value \"text,\" which serves as justification for the key values \"label\" and \"target.\"\n",

    "### Example 2: Aug 3rd 1994 Order on Liquid Storage\n",
    "Here is an image of the decree \n",

    "\n",
    "This decree, dated August 3, 1994, administratively authorizes the COGESAL S.A. factory in Argentan to operate its industrial activities, subject to compliance with numerous technical requirements. It takes into account a regularization request, a favorable public inquiry, and various advisory opinions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The decree regulates the following activities:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Storage of slightly and extremely flammable liquids.\n",
    "*   Refrigeration installations.\n",
    "*   Effluent spreading.\n",

    "*   Water protection (discharge standards, prevention of accidental pollution, management of rainwater and wastewater).\n",
    "*   Prevention of air pollution (limitation of smoke, gas emissions, etc.).\n",
    "*   Waste disposal.\n",
    "*   Noise nuisances (compliance with standards).\n",
    "*   Electrical installations (safety and control).\n",
    "*   Traffic rules on the site.\n",
    "*   Prevention of the risks of fire and explosion (detection, emergency resources, smoking ban, fire permit).\n",
    "*   Dairy and dairy product manufacturing activities.\n",
    "*   Refrigeration installations operating with ammonia.\n",
    "*   Combustion installations.\n",

    "The decree also specifies deadlines for certain studies or compliance, control methods, and obligations to publicize the decision. It repeals several previous decrees and declaration receipts."
